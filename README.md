这是我2024年暑假备考GRE的时候制作的应用程序，主要是帮助我背单词。因为我在背单词的过程中发现，有些词按照单词书的顺序出现我能联想到它的意思，但是当他冷不丁地跳出来的时候我就不认识了。于是我想如果能把这些词随机打乱，然后给出英文单词，考察中文意思，这样就能避免出现“熟悉的陌生人”。一方面有现实的需要，另一方面是我刚刚用Qt做完大作业，虽然很简陋，但是也有学到了一些基础操作。正是因为大作业的不如意，我才想借着这个机会把没有深入探究的问题好好解决一下。
## English Version
This is an application I made during the summer vacation of 2024 when I was preparing for the GRE test, which mainly helped me to deal with the obstacle of vocabulary. The reason why I decided to make such a thing was that I was confronted with a circumstance in the course of preparation that some new word could be easily recognised in the order of vocabulary book, yet became alien when they appeared unexpectedly. This facilitated me to develop an APP which can shuffle the words and show merely the word, asking you about its Chinese meaning. On one hand, I have a pratical need; on the other hand, I'd just finished my homework by Qt, accumulating some basic knowledge though my homework project was rather simple. It was due to the dissatisfaction with my homework that I hoped to probe on certain issues that I treated slipshodly before via this chance.
